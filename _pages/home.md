### hello, player 1!

i'm on a mission to make technology more playful, intuitive, and maybe a bit unconventional :)

hey there! ðŸ‘‹ hope you're doing great! welcome to my corner of the internet. whether you're here to check out my projects, collaborate on something awesome, or just chat about the future of human-computer interaction, welcome aboard! 

i believe in the power of play to solve problems and in technology's ability to bring people together. as a design researcher, i have been exploring the human mind and behaviour to build products and experiences that are delightful, simple, and innovative to designing quirky controllers (ever played a game with a color-sensing glove?), I'm all about pushing the boundaries of how we interact with technology.

feel free to explore my projects! enjoy your stay! ðŸŒ» likewise, if you're a high-schooler or undergrad who's interested in getting into human-computer interaction / research, i'm always happy to give advice if you feel like i can be of any help.

i am a pre-final year student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering, at Manipal University Jaipur, India. 
my goal? To create experiences that make people go "Wow, I didn't know computers could do that!"
