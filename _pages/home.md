### Welcome!

<i><b>"The real problem is not whether machines think but whether men do." â€“ B.F. Skinner</b></i>

hey there! ðŸ‘‹ hope you're doing great! welcome to my corner of the internet. here, you'll find all the cool projects i'm working on in the world of generative AI and computer vision, like multimodal interactions, information retrieval, knowledge graphs and tasks based on agents and large/vision language models. i'm particularly interested in developing systems that can integrate text, images, and audio for natural human-computer interactions. i also love diving into vision tasks and adding new features to advance AI. plus, i'm passionate about reading and exploring new ideas, especially at the intersection of neuroscience, cognition and AI ðŸ§ . i'm fascinated by understanding how the brain works and using that knowledge to push artificial intelligence forward (AGI is the dream, haha!).

feel free to explore my projects, and if you want to know more about me, just head over to the "About" section! enjoy your stay! ðŸŒ»
