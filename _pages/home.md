### hello, player 1!

i'm on a mission to make technology more playful, intuitive, and maybe a bit unconventional. enjoy your stay! welcome to my corner of the internet. ðŸŒ» 

i believe in the power of play to solve problems and in technology's ability to bring people together. as a design researcher, i have been exploring the human mind and behaviour to build products and experiences that are delightful, simple, and innovative to designing quirky controllers (ever played a game with a color-sensing glove?), I'm all about pushing the boundaries of how we interact with technology.

feel free to explore my projects! if you're a high-schooler or undergrad who's interested in getting into human-computer interaction / research, i'm always happy to give advice if you feel like i can be of any help.

i am a pre-final year student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering, at Manipal University Jaipur, India. 
my goal? To create experiences that make people go "Wow, I didn't know computers could do that!"
