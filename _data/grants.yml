- name: I began my coding journey in the 6th grade, focusing on Arduino projects and IoT-based applications. Some of my early projects included obstacle-avoiding and line-following robots. As I grew older, my passion for music flourished, leading me to produce and write over six original tracks that have been published on more than 100 platforms, amassing millions of streams worldwide. After high school, I returned to my engineering roots, pursuing a career in Computer Science and Engineering. In my first year, I developed iOS applications using Swift, working extensively with frameworks like ARKit and RealityKit to integrate augmented reality into apps, and created engaging animations and entities with SwiftUI. My interest in AI & ML emerged during the starting of my second year, capturing my fascination and leading me to delve into the realm of Computer Vision and Generative AI. Currently, I am focused on research in this exciting field. While I haven't published any papers yet, I am eager to contribute to the body of knowledge soon
