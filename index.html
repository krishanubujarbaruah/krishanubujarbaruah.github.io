        <p>hey player one, i am a third-year undergraduate student at <a href="https://jaipur.manipal.edu/">MU Jaipur</a>. i‚Äôm on a mission to make technology more playful, intuitive, and maybe a bit unconventional. enjoy your stay! welcome to my corner of the internet.
</a>).</p>


        <p>as a design researcher, i have been exploring the human mind and behaviour to build products and experiences that are delightful, simple, and innovative to designing quirky controllers (ever played a game with a color-sensing glove?), i‚Äôm all about pushing the boundaries of how we interact with technology.

        </p>
        <p>feel free to explore my projects! if you‚Äôre a high-schooler or undergrad who‚Äôs interested in getting into human-computer interaction / research, i‚Äôm always happy to give advice if you feel like i can be of any help.</p>

        <p>
            üåª i treat my work as a journal of exploration. every prototype, sketch, or research note is another entry in my ongoing study of how humans and technology can evolve together. i‚Äôm fascinated by the ‚Äúwhys‚Äù behind user behaviour‚Äîwhy we click, why we trust, why we feel connected to certain designs. (this curiosity) drives me to conduct deep research. my goal? To create experiences that make people go ‚Äúwow, i didn‚Äôt know computers¬†could¬†do¬†that!‚Äù
